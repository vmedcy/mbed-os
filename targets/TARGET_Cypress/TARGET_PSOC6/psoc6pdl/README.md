# PSoC 6 Peripheral Driver Library

### Overview
The Cypress PDL integrates device header files, startup code, and 
peripheral drivers into a single package. The PDL supports the PSoC 6 device
family. The drivers abstract the hardware functions into a set of 
easy-to-use APIs. These are fully documented in the PDL API Reference. 

The PDL reduces the need to understand register usage and bit structures, 
thus easing software development for the extensive set of peripherals in the 
PSoC 6 series. 
See the [PDL API Reference Manual](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc6pdl/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/index.html) for more detailed information.
Also see the [PDL Release Notes](./RELEASE.md) for supported Software and Tools versions, etc.

### Quick Start
See the [PDL API Reference Manual Getting Started section](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc6pdl/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/page_getting_started.html) for quick start instructions.
